### Load packages and data

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox) 
```

``` r
states <- read_csv("data/states.csv")
dennys <- dennys
laquinta <- laquinta
```

### Exercise 1

The Denny’s dataset has 6 columns and 1643 rows. In this datafile, rows
are individual Denny’s. There are 6 variables (columns), representing
each Denny’s address, city, state, zip code, and longitude and latitude
coordinates.

``` r
#getting rows and columns of dennys
nrow(dennys)
```

    ## [1] 1643

``` r
ncol(dennys)
```

    ## [1] 6

``` r
summary(dennys)
```

    ##    address              city              state               zip

    ##                                                                             
    ##

    ##  Max.   : -68.42   Max.   :64.84

### Exercise 2

The Laquinta dataset has 6 columns and 909 rows. Again, the rows
represent individual LaQuinta Inn locations. The 6 variables are the
same ones we saw in the Denny’s dataset, telling us the location of each
Laquinta location.

``` r
nrow(laquinta)
```

    ## [1] 909

``` r
ncol(laquinta)
```

    ## [1] 6

``` r
summary(laquinta)
```

    ##    address              city              state               zip           
    ##  Length:909         Length:909         Length:909         Length:909        
    ##  Class :character   Class :character   Class :character   Class :character

    ##                                                                             
    ##                                                                             
    ##                                                                             
    ##    longitude          latitude     
    ##  Min.   :-149.91   Min.   : 6.225  
    ##  1st Qu.:-100.48   1st Qu.:30.475  
    ##  Median : -95.27   Median :34.082  
    ##  Mean   : -94.79   Mean   :35.038  
    ##  3rd Qu.: -84.35   3rd Qu.:39.199  
    ##  Max.   : -70.28   Max.   :64.824

### Exercise 3

From looking at the website, I can see that Denny’s has no locations
outside the US. LaQuinta on the other hand has several locations in
other countries. These include countries like Canada, Chile, China,
Columbia, New Zealand, Turkey, and the UAE.

### Exercise 4

We could also figure out whether these establishments have locations in
other countries using just the datasets we have. Given the information
we have, it seems like some options would be getting either the states
or the zip codes for each location, and filtering for whether the state
or zip code for each location is a place in the US or in a different
country.

### Exercise 5

There are 0 Denny’s locations left after filtering for states that are
not in the US. This confirms what we saw earlier on the website, that
there are no Denny’s outside the US.

``` r
dennys %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 × 6
    ## # … with 6 variables: address <chr>, city <chr>, state <chr>, zip <chr>,
    ## #   longitude <dbl>, latitude <dbl>

### Exercise 6

The code chunk below makes a new variable for whether each Denny’s is
located in the US or another country. We now have a new dataset with 7
variables, one of which is our new country variable! Confirming our
earlier findings, all 1643 observations in the dataset are Denny’s
located in the US.

``` r
dennys <- dennys %>%
  mutate(country = if_else(state %in% states$abbreviation, "United States", "other"))

#did it work?
summary(dennys)
```

    ##    address              city              state               zip           
    ##  Length:1643        Length:1643        Length:1643        Length:1643

    ##                                                                             
    ##                                                                             
    ##                                                                             
    ##    longitude          latitude       country         
    ##  Min.   :-158.09   Min.   :19.65   Length:1643       
    ##  1st Qu.:-117.33   1st Qu.:33.00   Class :character

    ##  Max.   : -68.42   Max.   :64.84

``` r
dennys %>%
  count(country)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 2
    ##   country           n
    ##   <chr>         <int>
    ## 1 United States  1643

### Exercise 7

Running similar code on the La Quinta dataset shows us that there are 14
La Quinta locations outside the US. Now, let’s consult professor google
to figure out which country each of these locations are in, and then
plug those into the code for Ex. 8 to make a country variable.

``` r
laquinta %>%
  filter(!(state %in% states$abbreviation))
```

    ## # A tibble: 14 × 6

### Exercise 8

Great, now we have a country variable! We can see that, in this dataset,
there are 10 La Quintas in Mexico, 2 in Canada, 1 in Honduras, and 1 in
Columbia

``` r
laquinta <- laquinta %>%
  mutate(country = case_when(
    state %in% states$abbreviation  ~ "United States",
    state %in% c("ON", "BC")  ~ "Canada",
    state %in% c("AG", "QR", "CH", "NL", "VE", "PU", "SL")  ~ "Mexico",
    state == "ANT"  ~ "Colombia",
    state == "FM"  ~ "Honduras"
  ))

#did it work?
summary(laquinta)
```

    ## 4 Mexico           10
    ## 5 United States   895

### Exercise 9

Both Denny’s and LaQuinta have a majority of their locations in
California, Texas, and Florida. This isn’t very surprising because these
are 3 highly populated states. I also learned from professor google that
the high concentration of locations in CA and TX can also be explained
by the fact that Denny’s and LaQuinta were founded in California and
Texas, respectively.

``` r
dennys %>%
  count(state) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 51 × 2
    ##    state     n
    ##    <chr> <int>
    ##  1 CA      403
    ##  2 TX      200
    ##  3 FL      140

    ##  8 OH       44
    ##  9 MO       42
    ## 10 PA       40
    ## # … with 41 more rows

``` r
laquinta %>%
  filter(country == "United States") %>%
  count(state) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 48 × 2
    ##    state     n
    ##    <chr> <int>
    ##  1 TX      237

    ##  8 CO       27
    ##  9 NM       19
    ## 10 NY       19
    ## # … with 38 more rows

### Exercise 10

Both Denny’s and La Quinta have a large number of locations per square
mile both in states where they have a lot of locations in general, like
California, Texas, and Florida, as well as geographically small states
like Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maryland.

``` r
#dennys locations by square miles
dennys %>%
  count(state) %>%
  inner_join(states, by = c("state" = "abbreviation")) %>%
  mutate(locations_per_sqm = (n/area)) %>%
  arrange(desc(locations_per_sqm))
```

Now let’s visualize the relationship between Denny’s and La Quinta for
the whole United States. Neat!

``` r
#combining dennys and laquinta datasets
dennys <- dennys %>%
  mutate(establishment = "dennys")

laquinta <- laquinta %>%
  mutate(establishment = "laquinta")

dn_lq <- bind_rows(dennys, laquinta)

#visualizing relationship between dennys and laquinta
ggplot(dn_lq %>%
         filter(country == "United States"), mapping = aes(x = longitude,
                            y = latitude,
                            color = establishment))+
  geom_point()
```

![](lab-04_files/figure-gfm/visualizing-1.png)<!-- -->

### Exercise 11

Now we can recreate the previous visualization showing only the Denny’s
and LaQuinta locations in North Carolina. In this case, there is some
truth to Mitch Hedberg’s joke, as most of the LaQuinta locations are
pretty close to a Denny’s, although there are a few stray LaQuintas that
aren’t near any Denny’s, and there are many Denny’s located in parts of
NC that have no LaQuinta.

``` r
ggplot(dn_lq %>%
         filter(state == "NC"), mapping = aes(x = longitude,
                            y = latitude,
                            color = establishment))+
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5)+
  labs(title = "Locations of Denny's and LaQuinta Inns in North Carolina")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

![](lab-04_files/figure-gfm/visualizing-NC-1.png)<!-- -->

### Exercise 12

Now let’s create basically the same visualization, but this time for
Texas. As we can see, Mitch Hedberg’s joke doesn’t hold quite as well
here, because there are so many LaQuintas located in places where there
is no Denny’s. However, it does seem that, in places where there is a
Denny’s in Texas, there is likely to be a LaQuinta nearby.

``` r
ggplot(dn_lq %>%
         filter(state == "TX"), mapping = aes(x = longitude,
                            y = latitude,
                            color = establishment))+
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.5)+
  labs(title = "Locations of Denny's and LaQuinta Inns in Texas")+
